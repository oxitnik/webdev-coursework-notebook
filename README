Simple notebook web-application for my coursework project for web programming course.

Using:
    bottle.py + beaker  for backend
    Backbone.js + Twitter Bootstrap for frontend

P.S.:It is my first experience with Bottle.py and Backbone, so it may contain a lot of bad code.

Api reference:
    GET /api/notebook  - list of notebooks
    POST /api/notebook - new notebook
    PUT /api/notebook/:id - update notebook :id
    DELETE /api/notebook/:id - delete notebook :id

    GET /api/notebook/:id - notes of notebook :id
    POST /api/note - new note
    PUT /api/note/:id - update note :id
    DELETE /api/note/:id - delete note :id
